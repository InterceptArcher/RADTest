## Design Requirements (Implemented)

The Gamma slideshow generation has been updated to produce professional consulting-style decks:

1. **Professional Consulting Deck Design** - Clean, corporate aesthetic similar to McKinsey/BCG/Bain decks
2. **No AI-Generated Images** - Disabled via `imageStyle: "none"` parameter
3. **Larger Slides** - Using `cardSize: "large"` for more content per slide
4. **Consistent Sizing** - All slides use the same card dimensions
5. **Data Visualizations** - Charts and graphs prioritized over decorative elements
6. **Thank You & Feedback Slide** - Final slide includes feedback request and report metadata
