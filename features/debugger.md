i want to reformat the front end into more of debugger mode heres what this entails:
- after submitting the request for the company i want create a debugging ui that allows me to go through each element of the process to see what really goes on behind the scenes
- i want to be able to see all the values that each api returns for my inquiry and I also want to see chatgpt's thought process when resolving any data discrepancies 
- i want to see how each individual process leads to the final output 
- do this on a sort of dashboard ui that lays out the processes and outputs of each process step
